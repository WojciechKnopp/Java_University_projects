**Numerical Algorithms.**

Numeryczne - polynomial interpolation using Newton's method with difference quotients (the application calculates a polynomial based on six zero points)  
Numeryczne2 - comparison of solving equation $e^{-x} + 3x - 4 = 0$ using Newton's method and the method of simple iterations (user determines the accuracy and the initial starting point)    
Numeryczne3 - algorithm presenting a matrix in the form of LU decomposition
